PLATE Discovery Protocol
========================

I guess this could be called PDP.

I also haven't thought much about this yet. Stand by, or jump in. The requirements are:

* gossip-based
* includes a configurable level of lying
* a server never returns its own information via this protocol
* must figure out how to bootstrap the network
